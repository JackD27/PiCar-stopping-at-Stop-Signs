# PiCar-stopping-at-Stop-Signs
A self driving car that will stop at stop signs for a few seconds. It will then continue to move forward. It uses a RaspberryPi. It's called a SunFounder RaspberryPi car.
Uses a built-in camera on the car for the vision. This was my final project for my Computer Vision and AI class.
